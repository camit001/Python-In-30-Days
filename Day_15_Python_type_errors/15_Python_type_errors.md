# 📘 Day 15

## Python Error Types

When we write code it is common that we make a typo or some other common error. If our code fails to run, the Python interpreter will display a message, containing feedback with information on where the problem occurs and the type of an error. It will also sometimes gives us suggestions on a possible fix. Understanding different types of errors in programming languages will help us to debug our code quickly and also it makes us better at what we do.

### Errors vs Exceptions

Python reports many runtime problems as **exceptions**. An exception interrupts the normal flow of a program unless it is handled.

A useful way to think about debugging is:

1. Read the exception type.
2. Read the error message.
3. Check the line where the error occurred.
4. Fix the underlying problem.
5. Run the code again.

For example:

```py
numbers = [10, 20, 30]

try:
    print(numbers[5])
except IndexError:
    print("The requested index does not exist.")
```

Output:

```text
The requested index does not exist.
```

The `try` block contains code that may raise an exception, while `except` handles a specific exception.


Let us see the most common error types one by one. First let us open our Python interactive shell. Go to your you computer terminal and write 'python'. The python interactive shell will be opened.

### SyntaxError

**Example 1: SyntaxError**

```py
amit@PythonIn30Days:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print 'hello world'
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print 'hello world'
                      ^
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print('hello world')?
>>>
```

As you can see we made a syntax error because we forgot to enclose the string with parenthesis and Python already suggests the solution. Let us fix it.

```py
amit@PythonIn30Days:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print 'hello world'
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print 'hello world'
                      ^
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print('hello world')?
>>> print('hello world')
hello world
>>>
```

The error was a _SyntaxError_. After the fix our code was executed without a hitch. Let's see more error types.

### NameError

**Example 1: NameError**

```py
amit@PythonIn30Days:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print(age)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'age' is not defined
>>>
```

As you can see from the message above, name age is not defined. Yes, it is true that we did not define an age variable but we were trying to print it out as if we had had declared it. Now, let's fix this by declaring it and assigning with a value.

```py
amit@PythonIn30Days:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print(age)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'age' is not defined
>>> age = 25
>>> print(age)
25
>>>
```

The type of error was a _NameError_. We debugged the error by defining the variable name.

### IndexError

**Example 1: IndexError**

```py
amit@PythonIn30Days:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> numbers[5]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range
>>>
```

In the example above, Python raised an _IndexError_, because the list has only indexes from 0 to 4 , so it was out of range.

### ModuleNotFoundError

**Example 1: ModuleNotFoundError**

```py
amit@PythonIn30Days:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import maths
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'maths'
>>>
```

In the example above, I added an extra s to math deliberately and _ModuleNotFoundError_ was raised. Lets fix it by removing the extra s from math.

```py
amit@PythonIn30Days:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import maths
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'maths'
>>> import math
>>>
```

We fixed it, so let's use some of the functions from the math module.

### AttributeError

**Example 1: AttributeError**

```py
amit@PythonIn30Days:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import maths
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'maths'
>>> import math
>>> math.PI
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: module 'math' has no attribute 'PI'
>>>
```

As you can see, I made a mistake again! Instead of pi, I tried to call a PI constant from maths module. It raised an attribute error, it means, that the attribute does not exist in the module. Lets fix it by changing from PI to pi.

```py
amit@PythonIn30Days:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import maths
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'maths'
>>> import math
>>> math.PI
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: module 'math' has no attribute 'PI'
>>> math.pi
3.141592653589793
>>>
```

Now, when we call pi from the math module we got the result.

### KeyError

**Example 1: KeyError**

```py
amit@PythonIn30Days:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> users = {'name':'Amit', 'age':250, 'country':'Finland'}
>>> users['name']
'Amit'
>>> users['county']
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
KeyError: 'county'
>>>
```

As you can see, there was a typo in the key used to get the dictionary value. so, this is a key error and the fix is quite straight forward. Let's do this!

```py
amit@PythonIn30Days:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> user = {'name':'Amit', 'age':250, 'country':'Finland'}
>>> user['name']
'Amit'
>>> user['county']
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
KeyError: 'county'
>>> user['country']
'Finland'
>>>
```

We debugged the error, our code ran and we got the value.

### TypeError

**Example 1: TypeError**

```py
amit@PythonIn30Days:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 4 + '3'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
>>>
```

In the example above, a TypeError is raised because we cannot add a number to a string. First solution would be to convert the string to int or float. Another solution would be converting the number to a string (the result then would be '43'). Let us follow the first fix.

```py
amit@PythonIn30Days:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 4 + '3'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
>>> 4 + int('3')
7
>>> 4 + float('3')
7.0
>>>
```

Error removed and we got the result we expected.

### ImportError

**Example 1: TypeError**

```py
amit@PythonIn30Days:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from math import power
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: cannot import name 'power' from 'math'
>>>
```

There is no function called power in the math module, it goes with a different name: _pow_. Let's correct it:

```py
amit@PythonIn30Days:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from math import power
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: cannot import name 'power' from 'math'
>>> from math import pow
>>> pow(2,3)
8.0
>>>
```

### ValueError

```py
amit@PythonIn30Days:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> int('12a')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '12a'
>>>
```

In this case we cannot change the given string to a number, because of the 'a' letter in it.

### ZeroDivisionError

```py
amit@PythonIn30Days:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 1/0
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
>>>
```

We cannot divide a number by zero.

We have covered some of the python error types, if you want to check more about it check the python documentation about python error types.
If you are good at reading the error types, then you will be able to fix your bugs fast and you will also become a better programmer.

## Practical Debugging Checklist

When you encounter an error, do not immediately change random lines until the error disappears. Humanity has suffered enough from that particular debugging technique.

Use this checklist:

```text
1. Identify the exception type.
2. Read the message carefully.
3. Locate the failing line.
4. Check the values and data types involved.
5. Reproduce the smallest possible example.
6. Fix the cause rather than hiding the error.
7. Test the corrected code.
```

Example:

```py
age = "25"

try:
    age = int(age)
    print(age + 5)
except ValueError:
    print("Age must contain a valid number.")
except TypeError:
    print("Age must be numeric.")
```

This approach is especially useful when processing data from files, APIs, databases, or user input.

🌕 You are excelling. You made it to halfway to greatness. Now do some exercises for your brain and for your muscles.

## 💻 Exercises: Day 15
